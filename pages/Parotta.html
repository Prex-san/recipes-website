        <h2 class="bio">What is parotta?</h2>
        <p class="bio content">
        Parotta is one of the tastiest main dishes with an approprite side dish. The only
        problem is, parotta is extremely hard to make. In Tamil Nadu, a parotta stall is like
        McDonald's. It's good and handy but unhealthy. There's another similarity, in other
        countries there's a spot at a fast food firm for anyone who did not do well at school. 
        Here, we have the almighty parotta stalls providing employment for the listless ones.
        No matter what's happening in the country there's always income in a parotta stall.
