        <h2>What is parotta?</h2>
        <p>
        Parotta is one of the tastiest main dishes with an approprite side dish. The only<br>
        problem is, parotta is extremely hard to make. In Tamil Nadu, a parotta stall is like<br>
        McDonald's. It's good and handy but unhealthy. There's another similarity, in other <br>
        countries there's a spot at a fast food firm for anyone who did not do well at school. <br>
        Here, we have the almighty parotta stalls providing employment for the listless ones. <br>
        No matter what's happening in the country there's always income in a parotta stall.<br>
