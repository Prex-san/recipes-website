        <p class="bio content">
        Hello, I'm Raghu. I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
        I'm <em>not the best cook</em>, but I can certainly get the job done when it matters. Be it impressing your 
        colleagues with your sky-piercing culinary skills or cooking something mouth-watering to satisfy
        your ever-growing hunger. I've got you covered with my simple and easy-to-cook recipes. 
        Let's face it; if I can cook them, you can do it too! The food I make is primarily from Indian cuisine. 
        If Indian cuisine is not your thing, do not fret, I've got it covered. Some of my recipes cover
        universal dishes that should be able to satisfy the taste buds of even the best connoisseurs around. 
        <br>
        So, why are you waiting? <strong>It's time to open pandora's box!</strong>
