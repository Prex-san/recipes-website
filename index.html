        <h2>Chef's Bio</h2>
        <p>
        Hello, I'm Raghu. I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.<br>
        I'm <em>not the best cook</em>, but I can certainly get the job done when it matters. Be it impressing your <br>
        colleagues with your sky-piercing culinary skills or cooking something mouth-watering to satisfy <br>
        your ever-growing hunger. I've got you covered with my simple and easy-to-cook recipes. <br>
        Let's face it; if I can cook them, you can do it too! The food I make is primarily from Indian cuisine. <br>
        If Indian cuisine is not your thing, do not fret, I've got it covered. Some of my recipes cover<br> 
        universal dishes that should be able to satisfy the taste buds of even the best connoisseurs around. <br>
        <br>
        So, why are you waiting? <strong>It's time to open pandora's box!</strong>
